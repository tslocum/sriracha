# sriracha - Imageboard and forum
[![Donate](https://img.shields.io/liberapay/receives/rocket9labs.com.svg?logo=liberapay)](https://liberapay.com/rocket9labs.com)

This application is in pre-alpha development. Here be dragons.

sriracha will eventually serve as a replacement for imageboards running [TinyIB](https://codeberg.org/tslocum/tinyib).

sriracha will eventually support loading plugins via shared library files (`.so` files). This functionality is not available yet.
