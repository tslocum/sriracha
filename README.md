This application is in pre-alpha development. Here be dragons.

sriracha will eventually serve as a replacement for imageboards running [TinyIB](https://codeberg.org/tslocum/tinyib).

If you modify the source code of this application, you must share the full
source code of your changes publicly for free. You may, however, link with this
application with proprietary shared libraries, so long as the base application
(sriracha) remains unmodified. If your only changes are to create proprietary
shared libraries, and these librarires would work with other installations of
sriracha because you did not make any modifications to sriracha's source code,
then you do not need to release the source code of your shared libraries.
